# Identifying non-subjective thresholds for scalar indicators of coherent structures with percolation analysis

This idea originated in the work of Moisy & Jiménez 2004, JFM [1] while inspecting vorticity structures in isotropic turbulence and later adopted by Del Alamo & Jiménez 2006, JFM [2] for wall-bounded flows makes use of the observation that the ratio of the volume of the largest structure in the domain ($V_{max}$) over the volume of all structures ($V$) undergoes a percolation transition for increasing threshold values ($\tau$). At the lowest $\tau$, a seemingly infinite cluster appears as $V_{max} = V$ (a large structure spans the entire domain) and as $\tau$ is increased, the cluster breaks down into simpler structures. 

For wall-bounded flows, a necessary condition is that the scalar indicator has to be normalized with its root-mean-square over wall-parallel planes to ensure that a single, global threshold can be chosen to highlight the structures uniformly (see eq 3.1 of [2]). This was further explored for other scalar indicators of coherent structures such as low-and high-speed streaks, sweeps, ejections, shear layers, backs, and bulges in the work of Harikrishnan et al., 2021 [3].
